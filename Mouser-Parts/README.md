# Mouser Parts

## Description

These parts have been downloaded from Mousers product pages and integrated into this project using the LibraryLoader tool they recommend. Some of the parts have been modified, f.ex. to make the schematic symbol pinout more intuitive. 

## License

I couldn't easily find the licensing information on these parts and I've no idea which license applies to an auto-generated but modified schematic symbol... Some of the models (f.ex. the 3D model of the microSD slot) come from the vendor, but in that case I couldn't find a clear license on the download page or within the download either.
